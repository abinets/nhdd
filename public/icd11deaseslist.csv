During lactation, losses of folate in milk also increase the folate requirement. During pregnancy, there is an increased risk of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs), with risk increasing 10-fold as folate status goes from adequate to poor. Between days 21 and 27 post-conception, the neural plate closes to form what will eventually be the spinal cord and cranium.

Clinical findings are: dermatitis, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia. The role of EFA during pregnancy and lactation has been highlighted, and the role of long-chain n-3 fatty acids as structural components for the development of the retinal function and central nervous system is now accepted. The prenatal period is a time of increased risk for omega-3 deficiency, as maternal tissue stores tend to decline as they are used for the developing fetus. Deficiency of n-3 EFA can affect growth, and cognitive and visual function in infants. The characteristic signs of deficiency attributed to the n-6 fatty acids are scaly skin rash, increased transepidermal water loss, reduced growth, and elevation of the plasma ratio of eicosatrienoic acid: arachidonic acid. EFA deficiency in special populations has been linked to hematologic disturbances and diminished immune response.

There is evidence of significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to age 12, typically by typically early to mid-childhood, though some individuals may first come to clinical attention later. The degree of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning. Inattention refers to significant difficulty in sustaining attention to tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or frequent rewards, distractability and problems with organisation. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Impulsivity is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or consideration of the risks and consequences. The relative balance and the specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics varies across individuals, and may change over the course of development. In order for a diagnosis to be made, manifestations of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be evident across multiple situations or settings (e.g. home, school, work, with friends or relatives), but are likely to vary according to the structure and demands of the setting.

The most numerous of this group are the amphetamine-type substances, including methamphetamine. Prescribed stimulants including dexamphetamine are indicated for a limited number of conditions such as for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Methcathinone, known in many countries as ephedrone, is a synthetic potent stimulant that is a structural analogue of methamphetamine and is related to cathinone. All these drugs have primarily psychostimulant properties and are also vasoconstrictors to a varying degree. They induce euphoria and hyperactivity as may be seen in Stimulant Intoxication. They have potent dependence-producing properties, which may lead to the diagnosis of Stimulant Dependence and Stimulant Withdrawal following the cessation of use. Several Stimulant-Induced Mental Disorders are described.",category,1

This creates a favourable milieu for the growth of infection agents and may be caused by the obstruction or narrowing of sinus ostia, mucociliary dysfunction and changes in mucus composition. 90% of sinus infections involve the maxillary sinus. Chronic sinusitis refers to symptom duration lasting 3 months or more. Diagnosis of sinusitis is based on past history and physical examination findings. The CT scan is the most sensitive technique in evaluating sinus disease. The goals of management of chronic sinusitis are to eradicate infection, to relieve ostiomeatal obstruction, to normalize mucociliary clearance, and to prevent complications. When pharmaceutical treatment does not have any remarkable improvement or when a surgical approach can be chosen as patient's complication, surgical intervention should be aimed to establish an effective sinus drainage from the ostium. .

The ileal atresia is more common than jejunal atresia, and multiple foci are more common than isolated atresia. The most accepted theory regarding the etiology of jejunoileal atresia is that of an intrauterine vascular accident resulting in necrosis of the affected segment. Stenosis, on the other hand, refers to a partial occlusion with incomplete obstruction and accounts for the remaining 5% of cases.
